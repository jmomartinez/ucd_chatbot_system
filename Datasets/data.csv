What are the benefits of getting the flu shot?,Benefits of the flu shot include:
Does the flu shot work?,"According to the CDC, recent studies show that flu shots ​generally reduce the risk of flu illness by between 40% and 60%. This varies from person to person and season to season. Even if someone gets the flu shot and still gets the flu, several studies have shown that people who get the flu shot do not get as sick as people who do not get the flu shot."
What are the requirements of the new Interim Public Health Policy and how will it be enforced?,The campus has developed two interim policies to implement important public health directives and address student conduct and discipline during the pandemic.
"If some classes are held in-person, what will UC Davis do in terms of health and safety measures?","In-person classes will be very limited in number, have fewer than 50 students per class and will be those where the learning objectives can only be accomplished in person (e.g., advanced laboratory skills, some studio or performance classes, or fieldwork). These classes will follow strict public health guidelines related to required face coverings, physical distancing, disinfecting surfaces and ventilation systems, among others. All lectures and discussion sections will be held remotely for undergraduate students and for most graduate students."

We also recommend you consult your advisor regarding your individual academic plans."
"How will courses with labs be conducted? How will studio courses (art, theatre, design) be conducted?","This is being decided on a course-by-course basis after careful review of safety plans, as well as justifications for in-person classes.

Are there going to be caps on class sizes if they are offered remotely?,"Most remote courses will still have caps, though the caps may be higher than the equivalent in-person class. Courses must maintain reasonable enrollment caps to prevent overloading the work of instructors, teaching assistants and readers."
Will students have access to professors and office hours?,"Instructors will continue to hold regular office hours via remote means. If you have scheduling questions about office hours, contact your instructor."
Will professors be lenient if students are feeling ill?,"Instructors are encouraged to provide reasonable accommodations for students who are feeling ill.

How do I decide what classes to take?,Please consult your advisor regarding your individual academic plans.
Will remote online classes be recorded?,This is at the discretion of your instructor. Instructors are encouraged to record class sessions if it is feasible and appropriate for their course.
Will any courses be offered in both remote and in-person modes?,We are not planning to offer courses where some students join remotely and other students attend in person. All students in a course will receive the same method of instruction.
Can students enroll in an in-person course after the quarter has started if the enrollment cap has already been met?,Students will not be able to enroll in an in-person course that has already reached capacity. Please talk to your instructor if you are unable to be on campus by the start of the quarter.
What will winter and spring quarter look like?,"While there will be more in-person offerings in winter quarter than fall, most classes will be held remotely, including all lectures and the majority of discussion sections for undergraduate students and graduate students. We will continue to offer a limited number of in-person classes with educational objectives that can be met only through in-person instruction, such as several studio, performance, and advanced laboratory courses, and those requiring specialized equipment, as well as other specific requirements. These classes will follow strict public health guidelines related to required saliva testing, face coverings, physical distancing, daily symptom surveys, disinfecting practices, and appropriate ventilation systems, among others."
"If I need additional help with classes, who can I turn to?",Please consult with your advisor or instructor regarding your individual situation.

What are the factors to consider before electing to take a course P/NP?,Important factors to consider include:
How do I change my grading option?,Use Schedule Builder to follow the regular process for changing your grading option.
Can I change from P/NP back to a letter grade?,"Yes. You can opt for P/NP grading in a course, or revert back to letter grading, up until the P/NP deadline. For Fall, the deadline is December 11, 2020."
Will taking a class P/NP impact my GPA?,P/NP grades are not factored into the GPA calculation.
Will taking a class P/NP impact my time to graduation?,"That depends on whether a letter grade in the class is required by your major or college. Additionally, courses in which you receive an “NP” grade yield no units toward graduation."
I am repeating a course after taking it for a letter grade. Can I take it P/NP?,No.
I am not in good academic standing. Can I take a course P/NP in Fall 2020?,"Normally, you must be in good academic standing to take courses P/NP. For Fall 2020, you may petition your dean’s office for approval to take specific courses on a P/NP basis."
Who should I talk to if I’m not sure what to do?,"You should start by contacting your academic advisor in your Dean’s Office (or BASC, if you are a College of Biological Student) or your major advisor if the course you are considering changing to P/NP is specifically required for your major. Don’t panic if you cannot get an appointment with an advisor right away. Remember, you don’t need to make this decision immediately. The deadline to opt for P/NP grading, or to revert back to letter grading, has been extended to the last day of instruction for Fall2020 (December 11, 2020)."
Will my financial aid/scholarships be affected if fall quarter is virtual?,"Housing is one of the factors used to calculate the cost of attendance, so changes in where you choose to live may affect the amount of financial aid available to you. For example, living with parents is less expensive than on-campus housing. Estimates for different living options can be found in the Undergraduate Cost of Attendance."
Can I request a change to my financial aid for the 2020-21 academic year?,UC Davis understands that the financial circumstances of some families have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Affected students — both incoming and continuing — may file an appeal for revision to financial aid. Information about appealing for a revision of financial aid is on the financial aid website. The campus offers the Financial Aid Net Price Calculator to help undergraduates estimate how their financial aid may change based on new circumstances.
Will work-study positions still be available? Will they be available for remote work?,"Staff from Financial Aid and Scholarships are working with work-study employers, both on and off campus, to determine what positions will be available for in-person and/or remote work. The university has authorized more job functions to be eligible for remote work, and campus departments are actively looking to make more student positions available for remote work."
How does Pass/No Pass grading from the spring 2020 quarter affect my financial aid?,"The transition to a Pass/No Pass (or Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory) grading system may affect your Satisfactory Academic Progress, standards that a student must meet to be eligible for financial aid. For more information, please see the FAQs for Satisfactory Academic Progress."
Will CARES Emergency Relief grants be available?,"The student grant component of the CARES ACT provided one-time funding.

Tuition, systemwide fees and most campus-based fees are not increasing this year. More information regarding campus-based fees is included in this recent post. Some or all instruction for all or part of Academic Year 20-21 may be delivered remotely. Tuition and mandatory fees have been set regardless of the method of instruction and will not be refunded in the event instruction occurs remotely for any part of the Academic Year. "
What are tuition and mandatory fees being used for?,"Mandatory university charges for tuition and student services continue to help cover ongoing operations including the delivery of instruction and the cost of student services such as registration, financial aid, remote academic advising and mental health services. Our teaching continues, even as its method of delivery has changed. Students are connecting with and learning from world-class faculty, completing coursework, earning full course credit, and making progress toward an immensely valuable UC Davis degree. UC Davis student services continue to be available to students via remote options including academic assistance and tutoring, student basic needs and mental health, internship and career services, fitness and wellness programs, and many more to ensure that the term remains a very powerful and enriching one for our students. More information can be found in the Campus Resources section of the Student FAQ."
What is the status of Course Materials and Services Fees?,"With the campus providing remote delivery of instruction for fall 2020 and winter 2021, UC Davis is continuing to suspend all undergraduate and graduate Course Materials and Services Fees that are tied to specific courses. Course Materials and Services Fees associated with DVM, MBA, and MD programs, which have a different structure (generally charged at the program level instead of the course level), will not be suspended. Please note that you may see the fees reflected in Schedule Builder, however, the fees described above will not be charged in the billing process."
"If the numbers of COVID-19 cases increase, will campus suspend operations again? If operations are suspended, what happens to students living on campus?

Will parents be allowed to come pick up their students in residence halls if they become ill with COVID-19?,"If a UC Davis student is quarantined or isolated, they must remain within their rooms for the duration of the quarantine or isolation in compliance with state and county public health guidance. The campus will provide isolation rooms and food services for students living in on-campus housing. One of the purposes of the quarantine or isolation is to prevent any potential, further spread of COVID-19. This guidance may change based on guidance from county and state quarantine and isolation mandates."
"If housing is not guaranteed, will I get my deposit back?","Because many students rely on us for their housing and meals every year, Student Housing and Dining Services is committed to being open this fall."
Will I still have roommates in the residence halls?,"Student Housing and Dining Services has modified housing density for residence halls to align with public health guidance, and we are planning to offer single-occupancy bedrooms for 2020-21. Residents will pay the double-occupancy rate. We are working with our campus partners to help aid qualified students in situations of financial distress. If this applies to you, please email the Student Housing and Dining Services office for assistance."
What is physical distancing going to look like within the residence halls?,"Pending public health guidelines, common spaces such as living rooms will be open; however, physical distancing still needs to be at least 6 feet or greater at all times. Each resident will be assigned to a specific restroom. In addition, face coverings must be worn at all times whenever you are outside your bedroom."
What will physical distancing look like in the dining commons?,"At this time, we anticipate most students will take their food to go; we’re currently looking at offering online orders with “curbside pickup” as an option to streamline to-go meals. We also hope to have limited indoor seating, with seats spaced 6 feet apart, and are looking into the feasibility of table reservations to streamline dine-in services. To-go service is available at all dining commons, while dine-in service will be available only to students living in that residence hall area (for instance, Segundo residents will dine in Segundo Dining Commons only). In addition, face coverings must be worn on campus, including inside the dining commons, with the exception of when eating at the table."
What happens if someone in my residence hall gets sick with COVID-19?,"If a residence hall student tests positive for COVID-19 or is diagnosed by a physician, guidance will be given by the Yolo County Health Department and UC Davis Student Health and Counseling Services (SHCS). The student will be temporarily relocated to an assigned isolation space for a time period defined by public health authorities and CDC guidelines (typically 14 days)."
Will there be contactless ways to access spaces that require a student ID?,"Spaces requiring AggieCards for access are contactless. For example, accessing the Dining Commons is done by contactless swiping through a card reader before walking into the Dining Commons; accessing residence halls themselves, as well as their computer centers, is done by swiping the AggieCard through a card reader to unlock the door. There are no interpersonal contacts required for access. Students should continue to wear their face coverings and allow appropriate physical distance between themselves and others at all times."
How will decisions be made about who gets to live in the residence hall if there are room caps?,"Currently, Student Housing and Dining Services can house all students who have housing contracts."
What happens if my child is quarantined because they have or were exposed to COVID-19? Can I come get them?,"If a UC Davis student is quarantined or isolated, they must remain within their rooms for the duration of the quarantine or isolation based on state and county public health guidance. One of the purposes of the quarantine or isolation is to prevent any potential, further spread of COVID-19. This guidance may change based on guidance from county and state quarantine and isolation mandates."
Should I come live on campus or stay at home? When will I know if I have any in-person classes that would mean I should come and live in Davis?,Please review the information provided in the Classes and Instruction section regarding remote and in-person instruction.

However, the situation has been changing. Continuing F-1 international students in the U.S. can pursue up to 100% remote courses without having to leave the country, and continuing F-1 international students outside the U.S. can take remote classes while remaining in status. Incoming students are subject to additional government restrictions at this time, and UC Davis is committed to ensuring there are plenty of in-person or hybrid course offerings to help them satisfy the government’s requirement. Services for International Students and Scholars (SISS) continues to recommend that students currently in the U.S. not travel abroad if they intend to return to Davis for fall quarter.

Faculty are encouraged, as appropriate, to record lectures and discussion sections, offer flexible testing and promote an inclusive learning environment."
"If I go home and leave the country, will I be able to return to the U.S.?","This is difficult to predict as the situation remains dynamic. SISS continues to recommend that students currently in the U.S. not travel abroad if they intend to return to Davis for fall quarter. Be aware of U.S. policies on visitors traveling to the U.S. directly from certain countries, and be prepared to self-isolate upon arrival back in the U.S. Global Affairs regularly updates the campus travel announcements as new information from the U.S. government becomes available. Services for International Students and Scholars (SISS) within Global Affairs will work with international students to ensure they have the proper visa and travel documents and to update their term plans for fall 2020."
Where can I find information about securing and maintaining employment as a teaching assistant or a graduate student researcher?,"Guidelines for new and continuing international students are in development. It is imperative you stay in contact with your graduate program and Services for International Students and Scholars (SISS). Visit the SISS Announcements,  SISS Student FAQ, and Graduate Student FAQ pages regularly for updates."
Information for Graduate Students,"Please visit the Graduate Students FAQ provided by Graduate Studies. You can also view the COVID-19 information page for graduate students for updates on instruction and research, form submission and degree filing, leave and remote work and graduate studies events, specifically for the graduate student and postdoctoral scholar community."
"If I defer, what are my next steps in regards to housing, financial aid and orientation?",Students who defer to fall 2021 will participate in Orientation 2021 activities beginning spring quarter 2021.
Placement exams are conflicting with end-of-year exams. What are other options?,"Placement exams are scheduled for multiple dates, so students are encouraged to plan ahead and choose dates that work with their end-of-year exams. The Office of the University Registrar provides links to all placement exam schedules."
My school was closed and my final exams have been postponed. Will this affect my admission status?,"In MyAdmissions, please tell us if your school or exam authority knows they will have difficulty meeting UC transcript deadlines as listed in your conditions of admission due to COVID-19."
My school is unable to mail transcripts. What do I do?,The UC Davis website describes several options for sending official transcripts/documents. Please visit the website for updated information.
"Can I send in additional materials for my program to review, even if they haven’t asked for those documents (e.g. if my program requires three letters of recommendation, can I send in four instead)?","No. Programs must ensure that all applicants are considered equally. For that reason, they cannot accept additional application materials they have not specifically requested as a part of their application process. You should not send any materials to the program for review unless they have been specifically requested."
What should I do if I'm not sure how to answer a question on the application?,"If you have questions such as courses taken specific to the major, you may need to contact the graduate program office to which you are applying. If you have general questions about the application system itself, please contact gradadmit@ucdavis.edu."
Can I apply to more than one graduate program at UC Davis in a single term?,"Yes. You are welcome to apply to multiple graduate programs at UC Davis. However, you will need to submit a complete application, including a separate application fee and supplemental materials, for each graduate program."
Can I submit separate applications to the M.S./M.A. and the Ph.D. for a specific graduate program?,"No. Although you’re welcome to apply to multiple graduate programs, you cannot submit an application for multiple *degrees* in a single program. Master's degree programs are very different from Ph.D. programs.  You should review the requirements and program content thoroughly before deciding which degree you would like to pursue."
I found a mistake on my application after I submitted it - can Graduate Studies or the graduate program fix it for me?,"No changes can be made to the content of an application once it has been submitted.  For that reason, applicants are reminded to check their application carefully before they submit it. Notices reminding applicants that they will not be able to change or add any content in their application are displayed prior to submission. NOTE: Do *not* try to correct your application by submitting a new application to the same graduate program. Your second application will not be considered."
"Can I submit my Statement of Purpose, Personal History and Diversity Statement, or other required application content by mail or as an emailed attachment?","No. All of the content included in the online application must be submitted as a part of the online application. For example, applicants should NOT type ""Sent by mail"" or ""Will email statement later"" in the Statement of Purpose/Personal History and Diversity Statement section - it will not be accepted or added to your record."
My graduate program requires additional application materials which are not included in the online application process. What should I do?,Very few graduate programs may require application materials to be submitted using systems other than the online application. Check your program's website  to see if they require any additional application materials (e.g. an artistic or musical portfolio) and how they should be submitted. Do not submit any application materials that are not required by the program. Be sure to read all instructions carefully - most application materials must be submitted as a part of the online application process.
How much are the tuition and fees for graduate school?,"Please visit our Financial Support page for more information about tuition and fees, as well as funding opportunities for graduate students."
How do I get funding for graduate school?,Please visit our Financial Support page for information about graduate school funding opportunities.
How do I know which professor(s) in the graduate program match my research interests?,"The graduate program websites provide information on faculty research interests, and in most cases you will be able to access faculty biographies and publications through the graduate program website."
How do I know if the graduate program requires specific prerequisite courses?,"We recommend that you visit the graduate program webpage and review their application requirements. If the program has specific prerequisites you will find information about them on their website. If you are required to list your prerequisites in the online application, you will also be provided with a direct link to the prerequisite requirements in that section."
The application asks if I am a California resident for tuition purposes. How do I know if I might be considered a California resident?,"International applicants are not eligible for California residency, and domestic applicants must meet specific California residency criteria. We recommend you review the UC Davis Office of the University Registrar (OUR) webpage regarding California Residence for Purposes of Tuition. Once you have reviewed the information on the website you can make your selection in the application. Please note that you are only being asked to answer this question to the best of your knowledge. If you are admitted, OUR will request additional information to make a final determination regarding your residency."
Why does the application include specific questions regarding gender and sexuality?,"For details regarding why these questions are included on the graduate application, please visit our webpage on the subject."
I've already earned a graduate degree from a different university - can I apply for the same degree in the same field at UC Davis?,"No. Students holding graduate degrees cannot be admitted to the same degree program in the same field. For example, an applicant who has already earned a masters in Computer Science at another university cannot be admitted to the masters program in Computer Science here at UC Davis."
Can I double major in two different graduate programs at UC Davis?,"Applicants for two graduate programs administered by Graduate Studies must be admitted to at least one of the programs and submit a double major petition to join the second program after their first term. Applicants seeking degrees administered by both Graduate Studies and a professional school (law, medicine, veterinary medicine, or management) must complete applications and be formally admitted to both programs."
I was able to log in to the application system earlier but now it's telling me that my email address/password are not valid.  How can I fix this?,"If the system is telling you that your account login information is no longer valid, please get in touch with us using the ""Contact Graduate Admissions"" link at the bottom of the page."
"The Primary Email Address field lists an email address that I no longer want to use, but the application system won't let me change it. How can I update my email address?","We recently made the Primary Email Address field in the application ""read only"" due to the fact that some web browsers were automatically changing applicants' email addresses to different email addresses (which resulted in their being unable to log in to their applications). If you need to update your email address, please use the ""Contact Graduate Admissions"" link at the bottom of this page and let us know."
Where can I find the application deadlines for each of the graduate programs?,You can find the application deadlines for each of our graduate programs on our Graduate Programs & Deadlines webpage.
"I know what the deadline date is, but how late on that day can I submit my application?",Applications close after 11:59 p.m. (Pacific Time) on the day of the deadline.
I missed the final application deadline for the graduate program - is there any way I can still apply?,"Unfortunately there is not. UC Davis does not waive application deadlines. Once the deadline for submission has passed, it will not reopen until the next application cycle. However, we would certainly welcome your application if you choose to apply for a future term."
"Do *all* of my application materials (uploaded transcripts, official test scores, recommendations, etc.)  need to be received by the deadline for me to be considered?","No - not all of your application materials need to be received by the deadline. However, we do recommend that you complete your application as soon as possible after you have submitted it, and we also suggest checking with the graduate program to see if they require your application to be complete by a certain date."
"I submitted my application before 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time on the day of the deadline but the application system shows that it was submitted *after* the deadline. What happened, and will my application still be considered?","There's no need to be concerned.  The company that provides us with our application system uses Eastern Time, but UC Davis sets all of our deadlines for Pacific Time.  For example, if you submit your application at 11:00 p.m. Pacific Time on December 1, the system will show that your application was submitted at 2:00 a.m. on December 2.  But don't worry - UC Davis takes this into account when we review applications - your application is still considered on time as long as it was submitted before 11:59 p.m. Pacific Time."
What is the application fee amount?,The application fee is $120 for U.S. applicants and $140 for international applicants. The application fee is non-refundable upon submission of the application.
Does UC Davis offer application fee waivers?,UC Davis only offers application fee waivers to applicants who have participated in specific graduate preparation programs (for a full list see Graduate Preparation Program Participants on our Steps to Applying page). Applicants who are affiliated with these programs must indicate their participation AND must provide the name and contact information for their program coordinator in the relevant section of the online application system to receive a fee waiver.
Can I pay my application fee by check/cash/money order instead of paying by credit card?,"No - UC Davis only accepts application fees submitted by credit card. We are unable to accept personal or bank-issued checks, money orders, or cash. We are also not able to accept credit card information via telephone or email - all credit card payments must be made through our online graduate application system."
Do I need to list every college or university I have attended on my application?,"Yes, you must list every college-level institution you have attended in the online application, including all community colleges, study abroad coursework, etc."
How do I provide UC Davis with my transcripts/academic records to complete my application?,"Transcripts must be uploaded to the application itself, either prior to submission in the Academic History section or after submission via the application status page. Visit our Submitting Your Transcripts webpage for information about how to submit your transcripts."
It's my first term at one of the universities I listed and I don't have a transcript yet - what should I do?,Please upload documentation from the university showing that you are currently enrolled in the university and the courses you are taking. A current course schedule would be sufficient.
"Do the transcripts I upload for review with my application need to be ""official""?","No. UC Davis will accept scanned copies of original paper transcripts, unofficial advising transcripts, or even web portal-based transcripts.  The PDFs you upload do not need to be ""official"" electronic transcripts issued by your institution. However, the document you upload must include all of the same information that would appear on an official transcript (your name, the institution name, and all of your courses, grades, units, terms, etc.).  If the document you upload is not sufficient, the graduate program will contact you via email to provide you with additional information and ask you to upload a corrected version."
I'm a UC Davis student/graduate - do I still need to upload my UC Davis transcripts?,Yes. Unfortunately we are not currently able to automatically load your UC Davis transcripts to your application. You will need to upload your UC Davis transcripts for review. Visit our Submitting Your Transcripts webpage for information about how to submit your transcripts.
Do I need to provide transcripts for a college I attended if those courses appear as transfer credit on the transcript for the university where I earned my degree?,"Unless your primary degree transcript includes a complete list of the course titles, course numbers, units, and grades for each course you took at the other college, you will still need to provide a separate transcript. An assessment of transfer units or transfer credit on your degree transcript are not enough. All information about the courses you took must be available to the graduate programs for review."
Will I ever need to provide official transcripts/academic records?,"If you are offered admission to a UC Davis graduate program, you will be required to send official transcripts or academic records to UC Davis Graduate Studies. This is a required step for accepting your admission offer. If you are admitted, you will be provided with detailed instructions regarding where to send your records and what specific documents are required."
My college/university does not use a 4.0 grading scale. Should I convert my GPA to a 4.0 scale and how do I make the conversion?,"No. You should not attempt to convert your GPA to a 4.0 scale. Enter your GPA just as it is on your transcript. There are also fields in the application (under ""Academic History"") which will ask you for the GPA/Grading scale used by your college/university – you can enter that information there."
My transcript is a PDF which is is password/security protected. What should I do?,"Electronic transcripts issued by universities are sometimes security encrypted to prevent them from being modified or duplicated. Sometimes this can interfere with an applicant's ability to upload the transcript. In instances like this, the best solution is to print out a copy of the PDF and re-scan it so that you can be certain that there is no security/encryption which would prevent the transcript from being viewed."
I would like to wait to upload my transcript until after I've earned new grades or after my degree is posted. Can I wait and upload it later?,"Generally graduate programs want to receive your academic records as soon as possible so that they can begin reviewing your application. However, if you are currently taking important prerequisite courses or you feel your application will not be as competitive without new grades, we would recommend getting in touch with the graduate program to inquire about when you must have your transcripts submitted to be considered. If it will take weeks or months until your grades are available or your degree has posted, the program may not be able to wait."
"I already uploaded my transcripts, but I've now earned new grades. Can I upload the most recent transcript?","Only if you have not yet submitted your application (you can replace your transcripts by returning to the Academic History section of the application). However, if you have submitted your application and/or uploaded your transcript using the application status page, you will not have the opportunity to upload a new transcript."
I've started an application but I don't see a section for recommendations yet - how to I add recommenders?,"Because not all graduate programs require recommendations, the ""Recommendations"" section will not appear until applicants have completed the ""Plans for Graduate Study"" section."
Do all of my letters of recommendation need to be received before I submit my application?,No. Once you submit your application your recommendation providers will still be able to upload their letters of recommendation.
Do all of my letters of recommendation need to be received by the application deadline? How much time do my recommendation providers have to submit them?,"Graduate programs understand that, if an applicant applies shortly before the deadline, a recommender may not be able to get their recommendation in before the deadline passes. However, graduate programs will expect letters of recommendation to arrive shortly after the application has been submitted. If you want to make certain that your letters are received in time for your application to be considered, contact the graduate program directly to find out when they expect your application to be complete."
How do I remove a recommender from my application and add a new one?,"Even after you’ve submitted your application or the application deadline has passed, you can still log on to your Status Page and revisit the recommendations page (a link appears under your application checklist). Click on the name of the recommender, then click the ""Exclude"" button. You will then be able to add another recommender to replace them. You can replace any recommender as long as they have not already submitted a recommendation on your behalf."
My recommender can't find the request email - how do I send another one?,"You can send your recommender a new e-mail request if they did not receive the first e-mail *or* if  you just want to send them a reminder.  Log on to your Status Page and revisit the recommendations page (a link appears under your application checklist).  You can click on a recommender and use the ""Send Reminder"" feature to re-send them the email."
I re-sent the request email but my recommender still has not received it - what should I do?,"If your recommender does not receive the request email within 48 hours, take the following steps:- Remind them to check their spam/junk mail folders. The request email may be there.- Check to see if they are using an email spam screening system (e.g. Boxbe). If so, ask them to add gradadmit@ucdavis.edu to their safe contacts list.- Some non-U.S. universities have email firewalls that delay or prevent delivery of our emails. If your recommender has a non-university email address and is willing to use it for your recommendation, follow the steps in the next FAQ question below."
I need to change the email address I'm using for a recommender - what do I do?,"The process for correcting a recommender's email address is the same as replacing the recommender.  Log on to your Status Page and revisit the recommendations page (a link appears under your application checklist). Click on the name of the recommender, then click the ""Exclude"" button. Then re-add the recommender using their new email address"
My recommender is not able to access the system or upload their letter of recommendation. What should I do?,Ask your recommendation provider to contact gradadmit@ucdavis.edu and explain the issue they are experiencing. We will provide them with direct assistance.
Can my recommender send in a paper letter of recommendation? Can they send their letter by e-mail?,No. Letters of recommendation will only be accepted via the online application letter of recommendation system. Neither the graduate program nor Graduate Studies will accept letters of recommendation which have been sent by mail or by e-mail. Your recommendation providers will be given instructions for submitting their recommendations online.
My letters of recommendation are held by an automated letter of recommendation service (e.g. Interfolio) which sends out copies via email at my request. Can I send these in to you?,"No. Because your recommendation providers are required to provide both a letter *and* complete a short evaluation for you, any recommendations must be submitted via our online application system. We cannot accept letters of recommendation sent to our office (or the graduate program offices) by recommendation services."
Can I send in more letters of recommendation than what the graduate program requires?,"No. Graduate programs are only able to accommodate the specific number of letters they require.  For example, if you have five excellent recommendation providers and the program only requires three letters of recommendation, you will need to select only three of the recommendation providers."
What does it mean if I waive my right to examine my letter(s) of recommendation?,"If you select ""Yes"" and waive your right to examine the recommendation, you are only stating that you will not ask *UC Davis* to provide you a copy of the recommendation. You may still ask your recommender to provide you with a copy of the letter (as long as your recommender is willing to provide it). Responding ""Yes"" gives your recommender the option to keep their letter confidential, and the graduate program will know that the recommender had the opportunity to provide an honest assessment. If you select ""No"" regarding the waiver, you are indicating that you may ask UC Davis to provide you with a copy of your recommendation for review (though the recommendation still may not be used for any other purpose)."
Can I change my answer to the letter of recommendation confidentiality waiver?,"If your recommendation provider has not yet submitted their recommendation in the system, you may ""exclude"" them (see the instructions above) and re-add them to the list after selecting a new waiver option. However, if your recommendation provider has already submitted their recommendation, it is not possible to retroactively change your waiver selection."
Am I required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) and what is the minimum score?,"Each graduate program determines if the GRE is required. The university does not have a required minimum GRE score, but some graduate programs may post minimum or average scores on their website. Visit the graduate program website to determine if the program requires the GRE and for information on minimum scores."
How do I send my GRE scores to UC Davis?,GRE scores must be sent to UC Davis electronically from ETS. Use the UC Davis institution code (4834) when sending your scores to UC Davis. You do not need to enter a specific department code - the scores will be matched to your applicant record rather than to a specific department. Your GRE scores will be transmitted to UC Davis electronically and matched to your record using the information you provided in your application.
"When I order my GRE from ETS, what is the institution code for UC Davis?",The ETS institution code for UC Davis is 4834.
"When I order GRE scores, do I need to include the institution code *and* the department code?","You must use the correct institution code for UC Davis (4834) but it is not necessary to use a department code. Regardless of what department code you enter, your GRE score will still be matched to your application."
How can I tell if my GRE scores have arrived and been matched to my application?,"Once your application has been submitted, you will be able to check to see if your scores have been received yourself by visiting your Status Page. Please note it takes approximately two weeks after the order date or four weeks after the test date for ETS to make the official score report available to the university."
May I take the GRE more than once and/or report multiple scores?,Yes.  You may take the GRE more than once and self-report multiple exam scores. Please have ETS submit your scores electronically to UC Davis.
I already sent in my official GRE scores but I have retaken the exam and earned new scores. Can I send in the new scores to be added to my application?,"If you ask ETS provide UC Davis with a new official score report, your new scores will be added to your application record."
"If I apply to more than one graduate program, do I need to send multiple GRE score reports?","No. Test scores are matched to applicants rather than specific applications. If you have sent your scores and they have been matched to your record, they will be added to all of the applications you submit."
Can I send my own copy of my GRE scores? Or will you accept unofficial scores until the official scores arrive?,No. UC Davis only accepts official score reports send directly by the testing agency. Official GRE scores must be sent to UC Davis electronically by ETS (use institution code 4834).
I have not taken the GRE exam yet. When do I have to take it so that I can still be considered for admission?,Graduate program application review committees meet at various times to review the applications they have received. Please check with the Graduate Program Coordinator in the graduate program to which you are applying to determine when your application must be complete for you to be considered. Please note that it can take several weeks for official GRE scores to be issued. We recommend applicants take the GRE as early as possible.
How can I find out the current status of my application?,"If you log back in to your application after you have submitted it, you will be taken to the Status Page which will show the status of your application. Because the application review is primarily conducted by the graduate program and not by Graduate Studies, it isn’t possible for our office to provide you with more specific information regarding where your application is in the review process."
"I've already submitted my application online, but I’d like to make a change/addition to my statement of purpose/CV/writing sample/etc.  If I send the new document to Graduate Studies or the graduate program, can it be added to my file?",No. Changes cannot be made to the application materials you’ve submitted once you have already submitted them. That’s why we strongly recommend that all applicants carefully proofread all of their materials prior to submitting them. Applications are considered final once they are submitted – changes or updates cannot be made after you have submitted your application.
Can you tell me when I will know if I’ve been admitted?,"Each graduate program conducts their admissions review process independently. There isn’t a specific day when a graduate program makes all of their decisions. Once the program has reviewed their applications and has notified our office of their decision, you will be notified by e-mail. Please check your e-mail regularly (including your Junk Mail or Spam folders) to make certain you do not miss any important messages from Graduate Studies or the program."
Someone in the graduate program told me I was going to be recommended for admission. When will I receive my admission letter?,"Once a recommendation to admit or deny has been received from the graduate program review committee, the application must be evaluated by Graduate Admissions. You will receive an e-mail notice once a decision has been made. Graduate Admissions no longer sends paper letters – you will be notified by e-mail once your final admission decision has been made. Please check your e-mail regularly (including your Junk Mail or Spam folders) to make certain you do not miss any important messages from Graduate Studies or the program."
How will I be informed of my admission decision?,"Once a recommendation to admit or deny has been received from the graduate program review committee, the decision must be reviewed and verified by Graduate Studies. You will then receive e-mail notification and be given instructions on how to access that decision. Only Graduate Studies is authorized to formally issue an admission decision. Any notifications you may receive directly from the graduate program are not official until you have received an email from Graduate Studies. If you are admitted, be certain to read all information you receive very carefully and follow any instructions provided - there are several steps required to accept an admission offer. "
When do I submit the proof of financial support needed to obtain a student visa?,"Proof of financial support is not required until after you have been offered admission to a UC Davis graduate program. If you are admitted, you will be provided with additional instructions for obtaining your student visa, including where to send your financial documents. Do not send financial documents to the graduate program or the Office of Graduate Studies."
"When I fill out my online application, should I convert my grades to a U.S. 4.0 or A-F grading scale?","No - you should not attempt to convert your grades to a U.S. grading scale. The ""Academic History"" section of the online application includes fields where you can enter information about the grading scale used by your university. Be certain to complete that section thoroughly, but do not convert your grades to a U.S. scale."
Does UC Davis offer conditional admission to any graduate programs on the basis of future English language ability? Can I satisfy the English requirement after I've been offered admission?,No. Applicants who are required to take the TOEFL or IELTS must provide official scores before they can be considered for admission.
Do I need to submit an English language test score if I have earned or am currently earning my bachelor's/master's/doctoral degree from a U.S. university?,"If you have earned or will be earning a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree from a regionally accredited U.S. college or university where English is the sole language of instruction*, you are not required to submit a English language test score as a part of your application process (*applicants who have attended universities in Puerto Rico where Spanish is the sole language of instruction must still submit English language test scores). Please see our Test Score Requirements page for more details."
"I have not earned a degree from a U.S. university, but my university did teach in English. Am I still required to submit an English language test score?","UC Davis will only waive the English language testing requirement for applicants whose institution offers instruction solely in English. UC Davis Graduate Studies must review and approve requests made on this basis. Please see our Test Score Requirements page for information about who is eligible for a waiver, and contact us if you believe you may be eligible."
What English language tests does UC Davis accept?,"UC Davis current accepts the TOEFL iBT (both the in-person and at-home versions are acceptable), the IELTS Academic exam, and the IELTS Indicator. For applicants who are currently located in a country/region where none of these prior options are available, UC Davis will accept the Duolingo English Test by exception only. Please visit our Test Score Requirements page for more information.	UC Davis does NOT accept the Pearson Test of English (PTE), the TOEFL ITP, the IELTS General exam, or any other English test."
I have not taken an English language exam yet. When do I have to take it so that I can still be considered for admission?,Graduate program application review committees meet at various times to review the applications they have received. Please check with the Graduate Program Coordinator in the graduate program to which you are applying to determine when your application must be complete for you to be considered. Please note that it can take several weeks for official scores to be issued. We recommend applicants take the TOEFL or IELTS as early as possible.
How do I send my TOEFL scores to UC Davis?,TOEFL scores must be sent to UC Davis electronically from ETS. Use the UC Davis institution code (4834) when sending your scores to UC Davis. You do not need to enter a specific department code - the scores will be matched to your applicant record rather than to a specific department. Your TOEFL scores will be transmitted to UC Davis electronically and matched to your record using the information you provided in your application.
"When I order my TOEFL from ETS, what is the institution code for UC Davis?",The ETS institution code for UC Davis is 4834.
"When I order TOEFL scores, do I need to include the institution code *and* the department code?","You must use the correct institution code for UC Davis (4834) but it is not necessary to use a specific department code. Regardless of what department code you enter, your TOEFL score will still be matched to your application."
Will you accept the TOEFL MyBest™ scores (a combination of all of my best scores in each section from all of my valid tests in the last two years)?,"No - UC Davis Graduate Studies does not accept TOEFL MyBest™ scores.  All valid applicant test scores will be considered when they are sent to UC Davis, but they will be considered based on each individual test the applicant has taken. We do not accept ""superscores"" using the highest score on each section across multiple exams."
How do I send my IELTS scores to UC Davis?,"IELTS scores must be electronically from the IELTS testing center to the graduate program to which you are applying. Make certain that you make the correct selection to ensure that your score is sent to ""University of California, Davis Graduate Studies"". See our Test Score Requirements page for additional details."
I already sent in my official English language test scores but I have retaken the exam (or taken a different exam) and earned new scores. Can I send in the new scores to be added to my application?,"If you provide UC Davis with a new official score report, your new scores will be added to your application record."
How can I tell if my English language test scores have arrived?,"Once your application has been submitted, you will be able to check to see if your scores have been received yourself. Please note it takes approximately two weeks after the order date or four weeks after the test date for score reports to be made available to the university."
"If I apply to more than one graduate program, do I need to send my English language test score more than once?","No. Test scores are matched to applicants rather than specific applications. If you have sent your scores and they have been matched to your record, they will be added to all of the applications you submit."
Can I send in an unofficial copy of my English language test scores? Or will you accept unofficial scores until the official scores arrive?,No. UC Davis only accepts official score reports send directly by the testing agency.
What is the status of the housing guarantee for incoming freshmen and transfer students and second-year returning students entering UC Davis in fall quarter 2020?,"UC Davis guarantees on-campus housing to all incoming first-year freshman, transfer students, and second-year returning students. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, UC Davis may withdraw or amend this guarantee in the case of public health guidance or other extenuating circumstances."
Have contract cancellation deadlines been extended?,"Yes. The most recent change was announced via email on August 6. Read those emails on this webpage under Recent Messages. Also, continue to check your email. We will send new information as it becomes available."
"If I cancel my contract because of COVID-19, will I receive a refund of my reservation fee?","If campus receives public health guidance to reduce housing density for fall quarter due to COVID-19, we may ask for some student residents to volunteer to cancel their housing contracts. Students who then choose to cancel their contracts will have their reservation fee credited to their student account. If needed, additional details on the cancellation process will be provided. Contract cancelations, except when mandated by public health guidance related to COVID-19, are subject to the contract cancelation policy outlined in the housing contract."
What are my housing options if I defer enrollment for fall quarter 2020?,"Given the uncertainty of COVID-19 impacts, students who choose to defer enrollment will be provided an update on housing availability in future quarters as we learn more about state mandates."
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for me to pay my reservation fee. What should I do?,"If you're unable to pay your reservation fee because of COVID-19, please email studenthousing@ucdavis.edu to request an alternative payment plan."
Can I have guests in the halls?,"Residents are not permitted to have non-resident guests visit their buildings or rooms. We feel this is the best way to help comply with the physical distancing guidelines recommended by the county and state.
